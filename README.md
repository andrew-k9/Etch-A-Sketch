# Etch a Sketch

A simple implementation of the classic game (if you can call it that) of Etch a Sketch. Made for the first javascript project in the Odin Project's free online course.

## Notes

This is mostly an exercise in javascript, so its pretty bare-bones HTML and CSS. May come back to this at some point to make it look more aesthetically pleasing... Feel free to make comments on what is or is not acceptable!

## System

Ran this using Firefox version 58.0 on a Mac running High Sierra 10.13.2
